## Privacy Policy (DRAFT - Full Version)

HOT OSM provides a number of services and enables a wide variety of information exchanged online for the HOT Community. We aim to provide these services using methods that protect your privacy, transparent about how the data is used, and abides to local and international laws. Below is our privacy policy that outlines how and what information we collect through our services and tools.

### What this policy covers

This policy covers the products, services, and tools that HOT runs and its community members interact with:

* Websites and applications hosted or run by HOT OSM, including:
   * HOT’s website: www.hotosm.org
   * Tasking Manager: tasks.hotosm.org
   * OSM Export Tool: export.hotosm.org
   * OpenAerialMap: openaerialmap.org
   * All other web pages and applications with a hotosm.org domain

We’ll collectively refer to these as “our services”. The privacy policy does not apply to the third-party tools or services we use, like GitHub or Slack. These services have their own privacy policy.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### Information we collect from guest users of our services

Through the provision of services, we do collect some information automatically. This information helps us monitor and track what services are being used, how much, and how they are being used. We explain more below how we use this information. Information we collect automatically:

* Log Information: Information about who, where, and what type of access. Which includes: IP address, operating system, browser ID
* Usage Information: We collect information about how you used our services. This includes your browsing activity, i.e. what pages did you look at and for how long; and other information about how you interacted with our Website like what was your referral site, which can be used to identify you.
* Information from Cookies & Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. HOT does use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. 

#### Information we collect from registered users of our services

Several of our services require you to create an account and register as a user. Guest access is possible for these services, but a registered account is required for services such as the Tasking Manager, Export Tool, and OpenAerialMap.

Here is a list of information we may collect through a registered account (dependent on the tool):

* Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. This includes:
   * OSM or other third-party account username
   * Email
   * Facebook, Linkedin Twitter
* Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have profile page on hotosm.org, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or description that includes links to your OSM profile, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Your public profile information is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
* Content Information: Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content (such as for your website). For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly.
* Donation information: When you make a donation via Donately, PayPal, or Venmo, we collect personal data such as name, email, billing address. We also collect the specific donation information and any other details about the donation that you provide.

### Other Information we collect that you provide us

If you are a member of the HOT mailing list or newsletter, send a support question via email, or post a question on Slack, Github or other online forums, we may collect other information in the form of:
* Communications With Us: You may also provide us information when you communicate with staff or other community members about an inquiry or support question, or post a question in our public forums such as Slack or Github.
* Responding to surveys: We occasionally send out surveys or request response from the Community. We collect information such as your response which could include email, name, and other information that you provide.

### How And Why We Use Information
#### Purposes for Using Information

HOT uses the information that you provide or we collect automatically in the following ways:

* To provide our services to you and ensure they are working for you to use. For example, a registered account with the Tasking Manager allows HOT to provide you with the coordination services to conduct remote mapping with thousands of other volunteers. The information we collect through your account allows us to provide that service. We may use the account information to analyze usage over time or understand details about how the specific tool is being used or could be improved.
* To communicate to you through an email to provide you an update on Community activities, respond to your inquiry, or follow up to provide you technical support.
* To enable to you to access OpenStreetMap and other third-party services. Services such as OpenStreetMap require users to be authenticated in order to access specific data.
* To monitor and prevent any problems with our services. For example, we track IP and browser information to understand the location and type of requests for each site.
* Process your donation and adhere to legal obligations.

#### Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you to provide you with running services or enable access to our websites or third-party websites; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) We have a legitimate interest in using your information -- for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our services, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent--for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.

### Sharing Information
#### How We Share Information

We do not sell any data or private personal information collected. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

* Service admins or project managers: Depending on the tool, administrators or certain authorized users (project managers) may have access to username or other private data that has been provided.
* Employees, Independent Contractors, or Vendor contractors: We may disclose information about you to our employees, individuals who are our independent contractors, or vendor contractors working on a service that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require employees and contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.

### Choices and what you can do

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

* Limit the Information that You Provide: If you have registered on a service with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information.
* Opt-Out of Electronic Communications: You may opt out of receiving messages from HOT depending on the service. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of mailing lists or other messages, we may still attempt send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices if you are still a registered user.
* Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies: HOT does respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. In addition, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using HOT’s services, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
* Close Your Account: If you no longer want to use our Services, you can close your account. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above--for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests. For example, the Tasking Manager will continue to retain your username of the previous tasks that you completed for historical reference.
